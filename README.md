# ABOUT

num_guess is a simple game made in Rust that asks the player to guess a number between 1 - 100. It is a very simple program designed to teach me about Rust and some of the more basic things that can be done with it.

## GAME

The game is simple, when the program is run the user will be prompted to guess a number between 1 - 100, if they guess wrong they will be given a hint in what direction the real number is. It is in a continous loop so the player will have to either get the answer right or forcefully quit the program to stop the game.
